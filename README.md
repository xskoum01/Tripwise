✈️ Tripwise
Tripwise is a simple Python application for searching cheap flights and trips.
Currently, it can find flights from Ryanair — more sources will be added later.
Just enter a date range and optionally a maximum roundtrip price — Tripwise will find all matching roundtrip flights for you.

📝 TODO
- Add more airlines and vacation packages

- Advanced filters (days of the week, baggage options)

- Simple user interface (CLI/Web)
